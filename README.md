# Module-9
For this project, I designed tables to hold the data from CSV files, imported the CSV files into a SQL database, and then answered questions about the data. 
I performed data modeling, data engineering, and data analysis, respectively for the ninth module in my data science bootcamp. 
I did use outside sources to assit me with this project.
